v0.1 - Staccato


The first formal milestone for the project. 
With this release, users will be able to play music from the console's command line interface.
Users can also drag and drop a song onto the music player to play it as well. The user interacts with the application using console commands as well as a few supported hotkeys. A few pieces of metadata will be visible on-screen as well, such as artist, album, genre, current playing time out of total time. Users will be able to add songs to the current song queue, which plays in order and works like an in-memory playlist. No playlist saving/loading will be supported yet.
